The Heap is the runtime data area where all Java objects are stored. Thus, whenever we create a new class instance or array, the JVM will 
find some available memory in the Heap and assign it to the object. The Heap's creation occurs at the JVM start-up, and its destruction happens 
at the exit.

Following are some key points to undertstand JVM Stack Area âˆ’

During the creation of a thread, the Java Virtual Machine creates a separate stack.

The JVM performs only two operations upon this stack. The operations are push (i.e insert) and pop (i.e delete).

When a thread is currently in execution, the stack associated with it is known as runtime stack.

Every method call done by the thread, intermediate calculations, assignment of local variables, calling parameters etc, are stored as an operation in the runtime stack.

Once the thread stops or completes executing, the respective part from the stack is deleted.

Once all the calls by the thread are complete, the stack becomes empty, and is deleted.

Just before terminating the thread, JVM destructs the stack associated with the thread.

The stack that stores data associated with a thread is exclusively available only to that specific thread, and unaccessible to other threads.

This indicates that the data in the stack is thread-safe.

Every data in the stack associated with the thread is known as activation record or stack frame.

What is Abstraction in Object Oriented programming? Abstraction is the process of hiding certain implementation details of an object and showing 
only essential features of the object to outside world. 

It is different from Abstract class in Java. Abstraction process identifies commonalities and hides the complexity of implementation. 
It helps us in focusing on the interface that we share with the outside world
