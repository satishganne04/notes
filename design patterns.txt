solid principles

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means that a class should have a single, 
well-defined responsibility and should not be responsible for multiple things.

Open-Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be designed in
 such a way that new functionality can be added without modifying the existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. This means that objects of a derived class should
 be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This means that a class should 
only be required to implement the methods that it needs and should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend upon abstractions, not upon concretions. This means that a class should not depend on concrete 
classes, but rather on abstractions. This makes the code more flexible and easier to change as the dependencies are inversed.

factory design pattern

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class,
 but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's used to create objects without specifying the exact
 class of object that will be created.

 creation of different types of payment methods in an e-commerce application
 
 You can have an interface called PaymentMethod, and different classes that implement this interface such as CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, 
 and BankTransferPayment.

The Factory pattern can be used to create different types of bank accounts, like savings, checking, and credit accounts.

The Singleton pattern can be used to ensure that only one instance of a class representing a bank account database is created in the system.

The Observer pattern can be used to notify interested parties about changes in account balance or transactions.

The Decorator pattern can be used to add additional functionality to bank accounts, like overdraft protection or interest calculation.

The Command pattern can be used to encapsulate operations on bank accounts, like deposit and withdrawal, in separate classes.

The State pattern can be used to implement the different states of a bank account, like active, inactive, and closed.

The Template Method pattern can be used to define a common algorithm for processing bank transactions, while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations.

The Composite pattern can be used to model a hierarchical structure of bank accounts, like accounts within an account.

All these patterns can be used to provide a flexible, maintainable, and extensible architecture for a banking application.

It's good to have knowledge of different design patterns and their use cases to make a better decision when designing your application.

command design pattern


before any request we directly excutes in service logic

but now we convert request to command and then excute by service logic 

it has 3 parts In this example, the ConcreteCommandA and ConcreteCommandB classes implement the Command interface and encapsulate the 
request to the Receiver class. The Invoker class is responsible for executing the command by calling the execute() method.

command --it has coomsnds it is a interfaceand 

receiver-- -class  has all the actions 

invoker -responsible for executing the command by calling the execute() method.


Credit card operations: The command pattern can be used to encapsulate different types of credit card operations such as approving a transaction, 
declining a transaction, and refunding a transaction. Each type of operation can be represented by a different concrete command class, with the 
receiver being the credit card service.

The builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
 It allows for the construction of an object to be done step-by-step, through multiple method calls, rather than all at once through a single 
 constructor call.

  Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different 
  types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

The singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access 
to this instance. The singleton pattern can be implemented using the enum type in Java.


Here's how you can implement a singleton design pattern using an enum in Java:


public enum SingletonEnum {
    INSTANCE;
    
    // Add your instance variables and methods here
}
