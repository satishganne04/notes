jenikins 

it is a continous integration tool ,it is used to build , deploy it to the production 

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project

1)coninuous integration
Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a single codebase.
 The integration process is automated, usually triggered by a source control management system like Git, and includes building the code, running 
 tests, and generating reports.

 coninuous integration workflow
The continuous integration (CI) workflow typically consists of the following steps:

Code development: Developers write code and commit changes to a shared source control repository.
Continuous integration server detects changes: The CI server, such as Jenkins, is configured to listen for changes in the source control repository.
Build and test: Upon detecting changes, the CI server automatically builds the code and runs automated tests.
Report results: The CI server generates reports on the build and test results, including any failures.
Fix failures: If the build or tests fail, developers fix the issues and recommit the code changes.
Repeat: The CI server repeats the build and test process until all changes are tested and pass.
Deployment: Once all changes are tested and pass, the CI server can deploy the code to a production or other environment.
The CI workflow helps to catch integration issues early in the development process, allowing for faster and smoother software releases.

crate a new job 

1.clock on new job
2.give a name ,click on type of project(here freestyle project) click ok
3.give descripion ,check github project ,provide project url  , go down where "source code managment" give git , provide repository url
   down click on add -click on jenikins , give jenkins credentials , we can schedule , in down build , click on maven related thing 
   and give -clean installand we can send email notification
   click on apply and save 
4.go to jenikins ,click on our project ,click on build now ,

pipeline

pipeline is a workflow with the group of events or jobs that are chained and integrated with each other in sequence

a) pipeline is a process of continous delivery automation using jenikins job
b) each job contains some processing inlets and outlets
c) build deploy test release \
d)continous delivery pipeline


types of pipelines 
1.build plugin pipeline
2.declarative pipeline
3.scripted pipeline
